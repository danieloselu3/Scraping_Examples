# Scraping_Examples
Scraping a few sites using Python

1. ## Scraping Hacker News ##
We’re going to scrape the https://news.ycombinator.com/news front page, using
requests and Beautiful Soup.
Hacker News is a popular aggregator of news articles that “hackers”(computer scientists, entrepreneurs, data scientists) find interesting.

2. ## Scraping Hacker News API ##
Here, instead of scraping the site, we obtain the data from the api provided by the site administrator.
In web scraping, the unwritten rule is to always start with an API, only when there is too much of rate limiting, or when there is no well written API do we settle on scraping the site.
